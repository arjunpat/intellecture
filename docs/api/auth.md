# Feedback

Feedback basically has two APIs, one for creating a new "feedback" and one for updating thatâ€œfeedback."

## POST /feedback/create

Create a new feedback and returns an id to that specific feedback.

###### Example request body:

```javascript
{
    stars: 4
}
```

###### Example response:

```javascript
{
    success: true,
    data: {
        id: 4567898768982
    }
}
```

## POST /feedback/update

Update that same feedback object from by using the id you recieved.

###### Example request body (the only required field is "id"):

```javascript
{
    id: 4567898768982,
    stars: 5 // same field as before; can be updated if the user changed their answer
    comments: "this app is so amazing",
    tech_comments: "bad", // technical difficulties
    diff_stars: 3 // experience using the app (higher is better)
    helpful_stars: 5 // how helpful the app is to learning

Response will just be success: true or success: false
